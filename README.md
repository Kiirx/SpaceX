    I developed software to scrape data on SpaceX:

    Capsules, Rockets, Cores, Roadsters, Dragon

    to use the software you need Python as well as PIP to install the modules.

## Install Python : 

Go to Microsoft Store And Search Python 3.9 And Install this.

##Install Pip with Curl :

curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py

### If you not PIP :

python -m pip install YOUR MODULE

### If you have PIP : 

pip install YOUR MODULE
